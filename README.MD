# Framework Starters
This project is used to host skelton starter projects for popular web framework combinations.
Branches are used to house each project in its own environment without me having to create a bunch of differnt repos or a complex gitignore.


## Current Starters
* [Express w/ Coffeescript and Less](https://github.com/listba/SimpleExpressApp/tree/Express-Simple)
* [Express w/ React and Less](https://github.com/listba/SimpleExpressApp/tree/React-Simple)
